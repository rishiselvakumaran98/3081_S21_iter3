* \section routes_sec Designing and Implementing the different routes

  In the graphical simulation, we implemented different routes for the drone entity using the Strategy Pattern. 
  The three routes for the drone include the smart, Beeline and Parabolic. 

  \subsection e Strategy Pattern for the Drone Paths

  #### UML Diagram for the Strategy Pattern in the context of our project:
    \htmlonly
    <embed src="Istrategy_UML.png" width="50%" heigth="50%" href="Istrategy_UML.png"></embed>
    \endhtmlonly

  CONTEXT:
  In the strategy pattern, we create a context object which helps to represent strategies and whose behavior 
  varies as per its strategy objects that are being created. The strategy object uses the context object as a reference 
  while changing the executing algorithm. This phenomenon is possible as the drone acts as the context object in our project
  that would change the respective algorithms based on the context of the simultaion. In the project, defined an abstract class named IStrategy 
  that acts as the interface needed for Strategy objects to implement on. The IStrategy class consists of the pure abstract method 
  GetPath() that is used by the strategy objects such as Parabolic, Beeline, and Smart Paths to implement in the GetPath() method 
  from the IStrategy class for generating 2D vectors of directions for the Drone to navigate around in the simulation.
  In our implementation of IStrategy, we rely on composition instead of inheritance of objects for reusability and to have more flexibility to add paths in the future for the drone. 
  Instead of implementing a behavior, the Context delegates it to a Strategy. This delegation is necessary as the IStrategy class, in this case, would require changing behaviors 
  during runtime as the drone is initialized using the picojson object file which contains a "path" parameter specifying which 
  path the drone should take in the simulation. This way, the path is initialized in the drone dynamically during program execution. For designing the Drone path we had to implement on the Beeline and Parabolic path.  

  ADVANTAGE:
  The strategy pattern consists of a family of algorithms that can be defined as a class hierarchy and can be used interchangeably to 
  alter application behavior without changing its architecture. By encapsulating the algorithm separately, new algorithms complying 
  with the same interface can be easily introduced. The application can switch strategies at run-time. Strategy enables the clients 
  to choose the required algorithm, without using a “switch” statement or a series of “if-else” statements. Data structures used for 
  implementing the algorithm are completely encapsulated in Strategy classes. Therefore, the implementation of an algorithm can be changed 
  without affecting the Context class.

  DISADVANTAGE:
  The application using the strategy pattern must be aware of all the strategies to select especially the right one for the right situation, 
  Which could lead to possible runtime bugs if the particular strategy is not defined for the right situation. To fix this issue, a default strategy 
  must be set which the entites could rely on when the particular strategies are not used. Context and the Strategy classes normally communicate 
  through the interface specified by the abstract Strategy base class, which doesnt provide flexibility for starategies 
  that might require different implementations. Strategy base class must expose interface for all the required behaviours, which some concrete 
  Strategy classes might not implement. In most cases, the application configures the Context with the required Strategy object. 
  Therefore, the application needs to create and maintain two objects in place of one.

  Classes:
    IStrategy: We defined a class named IStrategy that has two methods: a pure virtual method named GetPath and a void returning method named SetGraph. 
    Although the SetGraph() was previously defined elsewhere, we changed its location to within the IStrategy class because when we call on Smart Path, we already need to have a Graph object defined, so this change was necessary.
  
  Methods: 
    GetPath() -> GetPath() is a pure virual method defined in the IStrategy abstract class is used by the strategy objects such as Parabolic, Beeline, and Smart Paths to implement in the GetPath() method 
    from the IStrategy class for generating 2D vectors of directions for the Drone to navigate around in the simulation.

    Beeline::GetPath() -> We overrode the GetPath method from IStrategy class. The y-coordinate of both the source and destination vectors are increased by 200 so that they float above the buildings. 
    Then, these two points are added to the path nested float vector. Once we are finished, we subtract 200 to the y-coordinate of the destination vector and add it to the path vector so that the drone lands to pick up the package or deliver to a customer. 

    Parabolic::GetPath() -> We overrode the GetPath() method from IStrategy class. We defined an array of vectors that formed an arc over the initial and final destinations of the drone, with offset values added to the drone's arrival position vector so that it would arrive in a smooth fashion.
 
    ### Our Initial Implementation of Beeline method within Drone:

    <embed src="Initial_beeline.png" width="50%" heigth="50%" href="Initial_beeline.png"></embed>
    \endhtmlonly

    Beeline Route: Initially, our challenge was that we were thinking of adding more points to the path to make the drone movement smoother. 
    However, this approach resulted in the observer for the simulation getting stuck due to large vector input values.
    We resolved this issue by designing a beeline path that includes only 4 subvectors: the drone's initial position, the drone's hovering position over the initial position, the drone's final destination, and the drone's hovering position over the final destination.

    <embed src="Initial_parabolic.png" width="50%" heigth="50%" href="Initial_parabolic.png"></embed>
    \endhtmlonly

    Parabolic: Initially, the parabolic path was just an array of vectors that formed an arc over the initial and final destinations of the drone. 
    However, the issue we faced was that the drone was cutting through buildings in order to arrive at the package. 

    ### Parabolic Resolution:
    Since this drone behavior is incorrect, we fixed this issue by adding offset values in the drone's arrival position vector so that it would arrive in a smooth fashion.

    Resources: 
    Lecture 19 was a good resource for implementing the strategy pattern. Lecture 20 was also useful for the strategy pattern, and also provided some hints regarding the implementation of the parabolic path.
    Lab 14 was quite useful to implement the parabolic path as it gave intuitive equations as well as a clear indication of where and how to implement them in the parabolic path. 
 
  \section cv Observer Pattern for drone movement

    #### UML diagram of the observer pattern in the context of our project:
    \htmlonly
    <embed src="observer_uml.png" width="50%" heigth="50%" href="observer_uml.png"></embed>
    \endhtmlonly

    The Observer Pattern is used to provide a one to many dependency between a specified subject 
    and any amount of observer objects. The aim of the observer pattern is for the subject to be able 
    to notify all observers about a change in state, so that the observers can then react to the state change 
    and execute their respective instructions.

 ADVANTAGE:
  The observer pattern is useful because it provides the ability for two objects to interact with each other 
  with the least amount of information about the other object that allows them to interact. Since the vast majority 
  of the information about the two communicating objects is withheld from each other, the developer is granted with the 
  power of changing object attributes in the middle of a simulation/program without the changes affecting the 
  communication between objects.

 DISADVANTAGE:
  A notable disadvantage of implementing the observer pattern is that it can cause memory leaks if not implemented carefully. 
  If one of the observers is deleted from memory without being unregistered from the subject, it becomes a dangling pointer. 
  Everytime the subject notifies the observers in the simulation, this unregistered observer will cause a segmentation fault.
  The observer pattern should, therefore, be used when a program contains multiple objects that are directly dependent on the 
  state of one object as it provides a neat and well tested design for the same.

  CONTEXT: 
  In our delivery simulation, we implemented the observer pattern for notifying the status of the Drone, Package and also the
  Robot Entities. We used the ISubject as the Interface to contain templates for the AddObserver, RemoveObserver and OnEvent
  methods that are used to notify the observer within the simulation on the status of the entities.

 \section team_sec Team Documentation
  New section created in mainpage.h containing teamwork documentation

  ## Team Meetings:

    ### March 23rd: First Meeting for the Team to discuss on the roles that each member would be taking

    - We decided on the the team members taking roles in the following manner: 

    #### Lucas: Development Lead
      Lucas made decisions regarding the type of code implementations we would need to provide in Iteration 2.
      Lucas also designed the implementation of the strategy pattern and observer pattern in the project, and explained
      to team members how they would use these patterns for the other features for the Iterations (eg: how would strategy pattern correspond to Drone, Robot, etc.).

    #### Rishi: Project Manager
      Rishi managed the timelines for each feature implemented by the group, and made sure everyone was on track during the project.
      This includes setting up meetings with Hamza, Shreyas, and Lucas to plan the implementations of every new feature we tackled, 
      as well as making sure that the implementations met the requirements set for the class by discussing them with TAs during office hours. Rishi 
      also kept track of the issues posted on Github with team members and actively checked status on those issues with team members on a regular basis.
      Rishi also designed the battery class, delivery rescheduling mechanism, and the new drone movements corresponding to the drone's battery level.

    #### Hamza: Scheduler
      Hamza helped to schedule the proper date and time for team meetings, and set up the discord channel for official group communication about the status of each feature implementation.
      In addition, Hamza also designed the Unit and Functional testing for all features of the classes, as well as implementing the beeline path for the drone. 
      Hamza also set up new branches in the GitHub repository for each feature that was to be implemented by the team. In addition, Hamza worked to make sure that the UML Diagram was error-free.

    #### Shreyas: Reporter
      Shreyas was in charge of the overall documentation of the program, as well as maintaining a structured coding style such as ensuring proper indentation was met and the code was self-documenting.
      In addition, Shreyas made sure to update the UML Diagrams and made sure that all header files were appropriately documented. Shreyas also helped to write mainpage.h and was in charge of generating the Doxyfiles and the mainpage (index.html) for the project.
      Shreyas implemented the multiple schedule delivery, Robot class, and Robot movements to the delivery. 

    On top of this, we also decided on the individual roles that we wanted to implement in the second deliverable of iteration 2:

    Hamza would be tasked with implementing the Beeline path and testing functionality for all of the new features.
    Lucas would implement the route-specific features such as the parabolic path, strategy pattern, and observer pattern.
    Rishi would be responsible for the battery class and making sure that the drone responded aptly to the changing battery levels (such as dropping packages when necessary), rescheduling the deliveries.
    Shreyas would implement the schedule delivery for multiple objects, the robot class, and ensuring that the robot reacted aptly to its battery levels. 

    ### March 26th: 
    
    Our second meeting was to discuss the difficulties we faced with the drone movement when implementing the new features. 
    In particular, there was an unforeseen glitch we encountered when delivering multiple packages: packages would not get rescheduled if a drone failed to work, and the drones would stop moving arbitrarily.

    These issues were discussed among team members and Shreyas came up with the idea to use a queue to organize the packages in a first in first out manner to facilitate package scheduling for the drones. 
    After the discussion, Shreyas took the responsibility to implement the queue. 

    Another topic discussed in this meeting was how the group would replicate a drone's schedule delivery functionality for a robot entity. 
    Earlier, Robot entities had an issue of not moving to the right coordinates. Specifically, the Robot would move underground in the simulation when carrying out deliveries. 
    We realized this issue was due to using Vector2D as the coordinate system for Robots. 
    After a brief discussion with a TA, our group decided to switch to a Vector3D implementation for the Robot class as it appeared to be more efficient and also removed the risk 
    of setting wrong y-values and affecting downward robot movement in the simulation. 

    ### March 30th: 

    We held a discussion 2 days prior to the submission deadline of the first deliverable to plan out the writing of Unit and Functional tests for the first deliverable. 
    The tests were implemented by Hamza after the implementation of all our new Delivery_simulation elements (the routes, paths, and robots) were completed.

    ### April 2nd: 

    We faced challenges with Google tests: some of the tests were not working due to their interference with Facade and dependency on the simulation to run. 
    We held this meeting to discuss possible solutions. A few hours after this meeting, we were finished with our Testing for Deliverable 1.

    ### April 12th: 

    On this day, we had two separate meetings: one from 9 AM to 10 AM, and another from 4 PM to 5 PM.
    In the first meeting, we planned out the way we would implement the beeline route. We planned out how we would approach the beeline route, and Hamza began implementation afterwards.

    In the second meeting, we checked in with Hamza on the status of the beeline route and discussed the battery class, strategy pattern, and observer pattern. Hamza's beeline route ran into the issue of observers being stuck.
    After some discussion, we realized this problem was occurring due to vector input values for the path being too large. We simplified our implementation of the beeline path to contain 4 subvectors corresponding to the drone's initial position, 
    hovering position over the initial position, final destination, and hovering position over the final destination respectively.

    After fixing the beeline route, we planned out our implementation for the strategy and observer patterns, as well as the modifications to the battery class.

    ### April 16th: 

    We scheduled our meeting on this day in a similar two-part fashion to our last meeting (9 AM to 10 AM, and another meeting from 7 PM to 8 PM).

    In the first part of the meeting, we began by ensuring that every feature discussed in our prior meeting (beeline, strategy pattern, battery, and observer pattern) worked correctly. 
    Once we received this confirmation, we began parsing through our header files to ensure documentation was done correctly. 

    We had a problem with the way our beeline pattern was implemented. Initially, our beeline was within our drone, which was very inefficient and error prone.
    Lucas had developed an interface named IStrategy that used the Strategy Pattern that could be used 

    We met again to get feedback from each group member to write the Team Documentation part of the mainpage.h, and decided to dedicate a final meeting to finalize the documentation by adding 
    visuals in the mainpage and finishing up the UML diagram. Hamza took the responsibility of finishing up the UML diagram, and the entire group decided to individually make sure that the header files were appropriately documented,
    all design requirements from Canvas were met for mainpage.h, and the code in the .cc files were self-documenting according to the standards listed in the textbook.

    ### April 19th:

    We held this meeting to review the documentation and finalize the second deliverable for iteration 2. The documentation has been completed and we decided
    to make our discussion of the delivery simulation route design more descriptive by adding additional images to describe our workflow during the iteration.

    ## The individual workload for each team member are summarized as follows:

    #### Hamza: Beeline path, Google Tests for Beeline Path and Parabolic Path, UML Diagram
      Implementing the beeline path was relatively straightforward, however, the google testing
      for the beeline and parabolic paths revealed some errors and fixing them, and making sure the
      testing provided accurate feedback and accounted for edge cases was the most time consuming aspect.
      I also modified the UML Diagram to match our individual variable name choices.
      Additionally, there were plenty of stylistic errors in the UML diagram, such as overlapping lines and
      incorrect directions for some arrows, as well as incorrect naming of various methods that I had to fix.

    #### Lucas: Parabolic path, Strategy Pattern, Observer Pattern
      Implementation of the Parabolic Path seemed fairly simple from the equations, however debugging the 
      equations and implementing them properly took about 1 hour. The hardest part about the parabolic path was defining the correct parameters, especially the doubles j and t.
      The offsets for the parabolic pattern was also an adjustment I had to make. 
      The Observer Pattern, on the other hand, led to a lot of segmentation faults in the simulation, primarily because of not unregistering observers
      before deleting them. However after setting the proper values into the picojson object file and calling the OnEvent method on them
      the observer pattern started to work smoothly as required for the simulation.

    #### Rishi: Battery class, Delivery rescheduling, Drone movements related to battery, dropping package
      The Battery class change level method was initially not configured properly initially to meet the 
      requirements for the battery depletion. To rework the method we just modified the current level of the battery 
      to be subtracted with change dt everytime the battery method gets called. The battery level was checked within the drone entity using "Drone_Alive" method
      that called on the Battery level of the drone and if the battery level is below zero it would return false. Based on the boolean
      value returned from the "Drone_Alive" method the delivery simulation decides if it should update the drone movement or not. If the Drone battery
      is below zero, the package held by the drone also gets dropped to a y-value of 257(ground level) where it rescheduled to the next available Drone or Robot entity.

    #### Shreyas: Multiple schedule delivery, Robot class, Robot movements related to battery, UML Diagram
      Trying to locate the data structure and integrate the queue into the delivery simulation to 
      schedule packages to the empty drones and robots was a challenge, and took over 2 days. 
      The Robot class was a relatively straightforward implementation, but it was quite tedious and
      took a long time to finish up. I believe the Robot class took around 7 hours combined.
      I also created a new UML diagram for our joined group iteration, and included every new feature we added to the project.
